# Registration-with-PHP
A Form that let's students sign in and login with all registered students list displayed. With an edit, delete and add button.
As usual I hosted it on my xammp server. The index.php file makes you sign in as a new student and the takes you to the login page
which welcomes you with your name from the database. With an option to view registered students which grants you an ability to add, edit and delete if you want.
